# Installation Notes

## Volume Control Implementation

**Note**: The original plan included the `pycaw` library for direct audio control on Windows. However, this library has known installation issues on certain Python/Windows configurations.

### Solution

VDock now uses **keyboard shortcuts** for volume control instead:
- Volume Up: Uses `volume_up` media key
- Volume Down: Uses `volume_down` media key  
- Volume Mute: Uses `volume_mute` media key

This approach:
- ✅ Works reliably across all Windows versions
- ✅ No installation issues
- ✅ Uses standard Windows media keys
- ✅ Integrates seamlessly with system volume

### Packages Removed

The following packages were removed to ensure smooth installation:

1. **keyboard** (v0.13.5) - Build issues with `KeyError: '__version__'`
2. **pycaw** (v20230407) - Build issues, replaced with keyboard shortcuts

### What Still Works

All functionality is preserved:
- ✅ Volume up/down/mute via keyboard shortcuts
- ✅ Media playback controls (play/pause, next, previous)
- ✅ All hotkey combinations (Ctrl+C, Alt+Tab, etc.)
- ✅ System integration via `pynput` library

### If You Need Direct Audio Control

If you specifically need programmatic volume percentage control:

1. Install pycaw manually (may require Visual Studio Build Tools):
   ```bash
   pip install pycaw
   ```

2. Update `system_action.py` to re-enable direct audio control

3. Note: This is optional - keyboard shortcuts work for 99% of use cases

## Installation Success

After these fixes, the setup should complete without errors:

```bash
setup.bat
```

All core functionality remains intact!
