# VDock Production-Level Refactoring Tasks

## Project Overview
VDock is a virtual stream deck application with backend (Python Flask) and frontend (Vue.js/TypeScript) components. The goal is to refactor to production-level quality with clean code, proper structure, and removal of test/mock data.

## Task Status

### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning âœ…
- [x] Initialize Memory Bank system
- [x] Analyze current codebase structure
- [x] Identify cleanup areas and production requirements

### Phase 2: Code Quality & Structure ðŸ”„
- [ ] Clean code review and refactoring
- [ ] Optimize project structure and organization
- [ ] Remove test/mock data and inner test files
- [ ] Create proper production-level files and configurations

### Phase 3: Documentation & Finalization ðŸ“‹
- [ ] Update documentation for production readiness
- [ ] Final validation and testing

## Key Areas Identified for Improvement

### Backend (Python/Flask)
- Clean up test files and mock data
- Optimize project structure
- Improve error handling and logging
- Add proper configuration management
- Enhance security and authentication

### Frontend (Vue.js/TypeScript)
- Remove test/mock components
- Optimize component structure
- Improve type safety
- Enhance error handling
- Add proper build configurations

### Project Structure
- Organize configuration files
- Improve documentation structure
- Add proper deployment configurations
- Enhance development workflow

## Production Requirements
